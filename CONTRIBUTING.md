# Contributing to the Forum project

Contributing to the project requires only one condition, you being a passionate developer 😎

The contribution guidelines are as follows:

- Contributers are not required to open issues.
- Issues will be opened by the project mentors (also the repo maintainers).
- Comment "claim" on an unassigned issue if you want to resolve it. The issue will be assigned to you so you can start working on it.


Enjoy 😁
